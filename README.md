# RenamerFX  
Tool for batch renaming files. Recurses directory tree and does a text replace on filenames.  

## Build & Run  
Requirements:  
* Java 11  
* Maven  

This is a Maven project not tied to any IDE. Executing `mvn clean javafx:run` in project root should suffice. JavaFX comes in Maven config.  

`mvn build` creates a self-contained executable uberjar in ./target.  

# Use  
Clicking uberjar or running it without arguments from command-line opens the tool in graphical mode. Giving it arguments runs it in command-line mode.
